# Changelog

## 0.11.1

### Fixed

- **Dragging a project to reorder the sidebar works again.** The drop marker showed where a project would land, but letting go left the order unchanged, in the desktop app and in the browser alike. The drop handler was reading which project was being dragged from state captured before the drag began, when nothing was.

## 0.11.0

Built on the Muse Session Protocol methods that shipped with Muse Code 1.3.0, each checked against a real `muse serve` host.

### New

- **Plan usage.** The 5-hour window and the weekly cap, as Muse reports them with each model call, with when each resets. A small meter sits in the sidebar footer and a full card leads the usage page. This is your actual allowance, not the API-rate estimate the rest of the usage page shows. (`usage/read`, `usage/changed`)
- **Goal controls.** `/goal <objective>` now sets the goal through Muse's own goal command, which starts work on it straight away. `/goal pause`, `/goal resume` and `/goal clear` work from the composer, and the goal panel has Pause, Resume and Clear. Hosts without the goal commands keep the old behaviour. (`goal/set`, `edit`, `pause`, `resume`, `clear`)
- **Background tasks.** A running tool call can be sent to the background and keeps running while Muse moves on; one running there can be stopped, and a bar above the composer stops every background task in the thread at once. (`task/background`, `task/stop`, `task/stopAll`)
- **Workflow controls.** Cancel a running workflow, and skip or retry one of its agents from the workflow details sheet. (`workflow/cancel`, `workflow/childControl`)
- **Subagent controls.** Message a running subagent, give a finished one a follow-up task, stop, pause, resume, reopen or close it. These appear on subagents that carry a subagent id; Muse Code 1.3.0 does not report one yet (meta-models/muse-code-sdk#13), so they light up once it does. (`subagent/*`)
- **Full tool output.** Output Muse trimmed in the view gets a "Show full output" button that reads the stored log a page at a time. (`item/readOutput`)

### Fixed

- **Reasoning effort now takes effect.** Muse Code 1.3.0 accepts the effort sent with each turn and then drops it before the model call (meta-models/muse-code-sdk#6). Helicon now also sets it as the session's standing default, which Muse does apply, and the effort picker updates the open thread immediately.

### Changed

- **Skills come from the session.** With a thread open, the slash menu lists the skills Muse itself resolves for that session, and refreshes when Muse says they changed; the `muse skills list` CLI call remains for new threads and for reading a skill's instructions. Skills that declare an argument hint show it. (`skill/list`, `skill/changed`)
- **Renames reach Muse.** Renaming a thread renames the Muse session too, so the CLI and `/name` addressing see the same name, and a rename made in another Muse client shows up here. (`session/rename`, `session/nameChanged`)
