# Changelog

## 0.21.3

### New

- **Pin threads to the top** ([#111](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/111), by [@aminamos](https://github.com/aminamos)). Pin thread in a thread's menu keeps it above the others in its project, in the sidebar and the command palette, the same way pinned projects work. Pinned threads are never settled automatically; settle one yourself and it keeps its pin for when you bring it back ([#107](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/107)).
- **Enter can steer the running turn** ([#108](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/108), by [@aminamos](https://github.com/aminamos)). Turn on **Settings → Composer → Enter steers the turn** and, while Muse is working, Enter steers the turn and Cmd/Ctrl+Enter queues the message. The placeholder, the send button and the hint follow. Off by default, so Enter still queues ([#106](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/106)).

### Fixed

- **The editor panel is no longer blank when setup is unfinished.** If the muse CLI is missing or Helicon's server can't be reached, the VS Code and Cursor panel now shows the same setup and error screens as the desktop app, with Check again and Try again.
- **The macOS and Linux setup screen tells you how to install Muse Code.** It gives Meta's install command to copy, says a Muse Code plan is needed, and links to the guide for a CLI that's installed but not found.
- **Signed out of Muse? It stays on screen.** When Muse can't start, usually because the muse CLI isn't signed in, a card above the composer shows `muse login` to copy, a Try again button and a link to more fixes, instead of a toast that disappears. The server error screen also links to a prefilled bug report.
- **Usage says "1 call", not "1 calls"** ([#114](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/114), by [@amanrock1](https://github.com/amanrock1)). The call counts on the Usage page, and the line about calls with no published price, agree with their number ([#68](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/68)).

### Changed

- **Install instructions that match what you'll see.** On macOS 15 and later, right-click then Open no longer gets past Gatekeeper, so the site, README and release notes now say: open Helicon once, click Done, then **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** (or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Helicon.app`). The Windows installer is not code signed yet, so the site no longer calls it signed and says what to do if SmartScreen warns: **More info → Run anyway**. The macOS and Linux steps now start with installing the muse CLI.

## 0.21.2

### New

- **Helicon is in your editor too.** The desktop app's sidebar now mentions the VS Code and Cursor extension, with links to both stores. Close the note and it stays closed. It never shows inside the editor itself.

### Changed

- **The extension is easier to find.** It's listed as "Helicon: Muse Code GUI (unofficial)", so searching "muse code" in the Extensions panel finds it.

## 0.21.1

### Changed

- **Up to date with Muse Code 1.4.** Helicon now uses version 1.4.2 of the Muse Code SDK; it was still on 0.1. It speaks the same protocol version as current Muse Code releases, so the protocol mismatch warning no longer appears.

## 0.21.0

### Changed

- **Better with VoiceOver and other screen readers.** These fixes come from a detailed VoiceOver review of the desktop app:
  - Focus stays in the thread you're in. After you answer an approval or a question, or press Stop, focus returns to the composer instead of the top of the window. Moving to the next of Muse's questions puts focus on its first option ([#96](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/96), [#97](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/97)).
  - The thread no longer rebuilds itself when a turn finishes. The reply you're reading keeps its place, and the steps behind it fold away in place instead of being redrawn. To keep those steps listed, turn on **Settings → Appearance → Keep work expanded** ([#98](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/98)).
  - Status is announced once per change instead of every second. You hear when Muse starts, needs your approval or an answer, finishes a plan step, and finishes, fails or stops. The timer and speed readouts are no longer read out, and running steps no longer announce "Running" ([#99](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/99)).
  - Each thread is a labelled region ("Thread: …") containing a Conversation region and a Composer region, so the VoiceOver rotor can jump between them.
  - Changing threads is always announced ("Opened thread …"), however it happens, and the composer is labelled with the thread a message would go to. Option+Up and Option+Down no longer switch threads when pressed with Control, VoiceOver's own keys ([#103](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/103)).
  - The model picker and the other menus of choices open on the option in use and read it as "selected" ([#100](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/100)).
  - Plan steps read as one item each, for example "Done: Add the route", without extra image stops ([#101](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/101)).
- **Cmd+N for a new thread and Cmd+, for Settings**, also listed in the menu bar (File → New Thread, Helicon → Settings…). Cmd+Shift+O still starts a new thread too ([#102](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/102)).

## 0.20.0

### New

- **Muse Code's monitors, in view.** Muse Code 1.4 can watch something in the background (a pull request's checks, a build, a log) and wake up when there's something to act on, without spending model calls while it waits. Try "open the PR, watch the checks, and fix anything that fails." Helicon now shows it:
  - A thread that's done but still watching shows an eye and "Watching in the background" in the sidebar, the tabs and the command palette, even before you open it.
  - Above the composer, a Watching card lists each monitor with what it watches, the command, and how long it's been running, with a Stop button. Muse replies once to confirm when a monitor stops.
  - In the transcript, the monitor reads "Watching …", and a turn a monitor started is marked "Woken by a monitor", since there's no prompt above it.

  Works in the desktop app and the VS Code / Cursor extension. Scheduled prompts (`/loop`) can't be driven from outside the terminal yet; Helicon will show them once Muse Code allows it.

## 0.19.0

### New

- **Helicon for VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf and Antigravity.** Helicon is now an editor extension too: install it from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=harjjotsinghh.helicon) or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/harjjotsinghh/helicon), or search "helicon" in your editor's extensions panel. It opens a side panel for the folder you have open, built for a narrow column: the threads you have open as tabs across the top, History for every earlier thread in the folder (searchable, grouped by day), and the composer at the bottom. It takes on your editor's theme and font, file links in replies open in editor tabs, and copy and paste go through the editor's clipboard. The full app, with every project, is one command away in an editor tab. It runs Helicon's server on your editor's own runtime, so the install is about 1 MB. In Remote-SSH and WSL windows it runs next to your code; that setup is less tested, so please report anything that breaks.
- **The files a thread changed, above the composer.** A card lists every file the thread has edited, with its added and removed lines and a total. Click a file to open it. Fold the card away and it stays folded for that thread. Keeping or undoing changes from here is planned in [#94](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/94).

### Changed

- **Adding a folder shows it straight away.** Adding a project also lists its past threads through Muse, which can take several seconds; the project now appears first and its threads fill in when Muse answers.

## 0.18.0

### New

- **Projects on another machine, over SSH** ([#56](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/56), by [@dinhvh](https://github.com/dinhvh)). Add project has a new source, SSH host: type `host` or `user@host`, browse that machine's folders, and add one as a project. Its threads run Muse on the remote machine over `ssh`, so the code never has to leave it. It needs `ssh <host>` to already work without a password (a key or an agent); port, user and key come from your SSH config. On Windows, Helicon uses Windows' own `ssh.exe`, so keys and config live in `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh`, not in WSL. SSH projects always use the Muse login on the remote machine, so the account picker is hidden for them, and their threads keep the first message as the title instead of asking your local login for one. The file viewer, the skills list, file attachments (images still work), creating folders and cloning are not available for SSH projects yet. When the connection fails, the error now says why: an unknown host key, a login that needs a password, or `ssh` not installed.

### Also

- The helicon.sh 404 page has a "Skip to content" link, and the demo video player now has a name and reads its position as a time for screen readers ([#87](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/87), by [@GhostCoder6969](https://github.com/GhostCoder6969)).
- Contributors can run the whole interface without Muse: `npm run dev:demo --workspace @helicon/web` uses sample projects and threads. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/blob/prod/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 0.17.1

### Fixed

- **A message you sent no longer shows up twice** ([#55](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/55), reported by [@transformingegg](https://github.com/transformingegg)). When a thread reloaded while your message was on its way, the reload showed both the copy from Muse's history and Helicon's own local copy of it, so the same message appeared twice. The local copy is now dropped once the history has it. If you still see a message three times, or Muse answering the same message more than once, please add to the issue.

## 0.17.0

### Changed

- **New icons, one set everywhere** ([#16](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/16)). Helicon now uses [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com) icons throughout, the same family as the website, so the app, the web build and the live demos on helicon.sh finally match. Every icon keeps its meaning and place; they are slightly rounder and a touch more solid. The stop button is a filled square, and the Windows, macOS, Linux and GitHub marks on the site come from the same set.

## 0.16.1

### Fixed

- **A turn waiting on your answer is no longer treated as stuck** ([#54](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/54), reported by [@ntindle](https://github.com/ntindle)). When Muse asked a question and you took more than a minute or so to answer, Helicon read the quiet as a dead connection: it reloaded the thread twice, then said the thread had stopped receiving updates, and could show the turn as failed even though it carried on as soon as you answered. A thread waiting on a question or an approval is now left alone for as long as it waits.

## 0.16.0

### New

- **More than one Muse login** ([#45](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/45)). Settings has an Accounts panel: add a named profile, rename it, remove it, and sign in to it without leaving the app. Helicon runs `muse login` under that profile and shows you the device link and code; when Muse runs in WSL it gives you the one command to run in a terminal instead. Each project remembers which account its new threads start on, set from a picker beside the model picker, and threads running under a named profile carry a small chip in the sidebar. The usage page shows a plan meter per account, and when the account you are about to use is near its cap and another has room, the new-thread screen says so; nothing switches on its own. Profiles are managed by [aonia](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/aonia), so the CLI still owns every login and Helicon stores no credentials. If `META_API_KEY` is set, every profile inherits it and shares one login, and Settings warns you. With no profiles configured, nothing changes.
- **YOLO mode** (built by [@margantcovka](https://github.com/margantcovka) in [#46](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/46)). One switch for the full `muse --yolo` posture: no approvals, no sandbox, trusted workspace. It sits in the permissions menu and in Settings, behind a confirmation. Approvals turn off for every open thread at once; the sandbox part applies to new threads only, for the same reason as the sandbox switch in 0.15.0. Switching it off restores the modes you had before.

### Fixed

- **Refreshing threads also refreshes plan usage** ([#50](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/50), fixed by [@aminamos](https://github.com/aminamos) in [#51](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/51)). The refresh button re-read your sessions but not your usage, so work done in the terminal never moved the meter until something else did.

## 0.15.0

### New

- **Muse's sandbox can be switched off** ([#34](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/34), built by [@orkuhh](https://github.com/orkuhh) in [#35](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/35)). Muse runs shell commands inside an operating-system sandbox, which on Windows blocks a lot of ordinary work. Settings now has a switch to turn it off, behind a confirmation that says plainly what you are giving up. Turning it on or off restarts Muse in the background; anything mid-turn stops and says so, and threads pick up again on their next use.

  It applies to new threads only, and that is Muse's rule rather than a shortcut here: Muse fixes each thread's sandbox when the thread is created and nothing can change it afterwards. A thread created while the sandbox is off stays that way even after you turn it back on, so those threads carry a "Sandbox off" badge in the sidebar, the thread header and the command palette.

## 0.14.3

### Fixed

- **A thread that stops receiving updates says so** ([#42](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/42), reported by [@margantcovka](https://github.com/margantcovka)). When a turn's live updates go quiet, Helicon reloads the thread's history twice to catch up. If that does not move the turn on, it used to leave a spinner turning for ever. It now says the thread stopped receiving updates, explains that Muse is probably still working, and offers a reload.

### Changed

- **Helicon can now say whether a thread went quiet or was simply idle.** A long report of turns finishing while their view stood still could not be diagnosed, because nothing here recorded anything about the feed of updates. Each session now tracks when it last received one and what it received, frames the protocol refuses are recorded instead of vanishing, and updates that arrive without a session to belong to are counted rather than dropped in silence. All of it reads from `/api/health`. Nothing new leaves your machine: this is written to the local daemon and stays there.
- **One bad update can no longer take down every thread at once.** Handling an update ran unguarded inside the connection's read loop, so a single failure would have ended the connection to Muse and every thread on it. A failure is now contained to the update that caused it.

## 0.14.2

### Fixed

- **A thread stops freezing part-way through a long run** ([#32](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/32), found and fixed by [@margantcovka](https://github.com/margantcovka) in [#41](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/41)). 0.13.1 fixed one cause of this and missed the rest: it still happened with no subagents at all, on a thread of roughly 487 tool calls. Three things were wrong. Reloading a thread while another load was still running threw away every event that arrived in the meantime, so a turn's ending could vanish and the view would show it running for ever. Streaming text, long tool output and very large edits were each re-processed in full on every frame, which stalled the window as a thread grew. And a thread whose stream goes quiet now reloads itself instead of sitting there, which is what restarting the app used to do for you.

## 0.14.1

Same app as 0.14.0 on Windows and macOS. The step that repacks the Linux AppImage without its stale Wayland libraries failed on its first real run, so 0.14.0's AppImage still carried them; it is repacked properly here. Windows and macOS users on 0.14.0 lose nothing by updating.

## 0.14.0

### New

- **Session statistics above the composer** ([#39](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/39), built by [@jorgitin02](https://github.com/jorgitin02)). Two pills summarise the open thread: turns, steps and the request-average speed in one, exact token counts with the cache split and a per-model breakdown in the other. Everything is worked out from the thread's own history on your machine; nothing is sent anywhere. Off by default, switched on under Settings -> Appearance -> Session statistics. On a long thread where only part of the history is loaded, the numbers say so rather than quietly under-reporting: details are marked *Partial* and the token total carries a `+`.

### Fixed

- **The Linux AppImage opens on current distributions** ([#38](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/38), thanks [@orkuhh](https://github.com/orkuhh)). The bundler shipped Ubuntu 22.04's Wayland libraries inside the AppImage, and a newer system's graphics stack could not initialise against them, so the window never appeared ([tauri-apps/tauri#15665](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/15665)). The release now repacks the AppImage without those libraries so it uses the ones already on your system.
- **Two clicks that went to the wrong place** ([#36](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/36), [#37](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/37)). Finishing a sidebar drag no longer opens the thread you dropped, and Alt with the arrow keys no longer jumps threads while you are typing in the composer.

### Changed

- **Short durations read in milliseconds.** A tool call that took under a second used to say "under 1s", which told you nothing; it now says `412ms`.

## 0.13.1

### Fixed

- **A thread that ran subagents no longer grinds to a halt** ([#32](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/32), reported by [@margantcovka](https://github.com/margantcovka)). Applying an event copied the whole thread's state, so each event cost more as the thread grew, and a long one eventually stopped updating while the work carried on without it. Subagent children drove the count, which is why only those threads hung: 20,000 of them took 36 seconds to apply and now take 8 milliseconds. They are also left out of the thread entirely now, since nothing ever showed them.

## 0.13.0

### New

- **Threads get a short generated title** ([#29](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/29), built by [@orkuhh](https://github.com/orkuhh) in [#28](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/28)). The first prompt still names a thread instantly, then one cheap `muse exec` call replaces the echo with a concise title and pushes it back to Muse Code, so the CLI shows the same name. A typed title, or a name Muse Code chose itself, is never touched, and anything that fails leaves the echo in place. Settings has a switch, a model choice, and says plainly that the calls run on your plan; off means no calls at all.

### Changed

- **Back on Settings and Usage returns where you came from** ([#27](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/27), thanks [@orkuhh](https://github.com/orkuhh)), instead of always going home.
- **The desktop app asks helicon.sh for updates**, falling back to GitHub as before. That request is how we count roughly how many installs are in use, since downloads and stars say nothing about that: the platform, the version, and a hash of the IP salted per week, so two weeks of logs cannot be joined. Nothing about your code, prompts or files leaves your machine, and the README and FAQ both say so.
- **"Muse Code" everywhere it means the CLI.** Meta now ships a consumer assistant called Muse for Mac; Helicon is a client for Muse Code and unrelated to it, so the site and README never say bare "Muse" and both disclaimers name the two apart.

## 0.12.6

### New

- **Linux builds.** Releases now carry an x86_64 AppImage, which runs on most distributions and updates itself from then on. Thanks to [@orkuhh](https://github.com/orkuhh) ([#23](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/23)), who also added Ubuntu to CI. A `.deb` will follow: Tauri's Debian bundler would install the bundled Node.js as `/usr/bin/node`, which collides with Debian's own `nodejs` package.

### Fixed

- **A collapsed sidebar can be reopened from Usage and Settings** ([#24](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/pull/24), thanks [@orkuhh](https://github.com/orkuhh)). Those pages draw their own header and had no toggle, so the only ways back were the Back button and Cmd/Ctrl+B.

### Changed

- **Plan usage says how old its numbers are** ([#26](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/26)). Muse reports your plan's allowance with a model call and at no other time, so each row now carries the reading's age, and the card says plainly that the numbers only move when you send a prompt from a thread here. Work done in the terminal counts against the plan without ever reaching this card.

## 0.12.5

Same app as 0.12.4. GitHub refused the macOS update package on every upload attempt for that release, so macOS could not update itself to it; the release job now retries uploads. Windows users on 0.12.4 lose nothing by updating.

## 0.12.4

### Fixed

- **A failed turn's red banner no longer sticks around** ([#22](https://github.com/HarjjotSinghh/helicon/issues/22)). The banner has a close button, and a closed or retried banner stays closed when the thread reloads; before, reopening the thread or restarting the app brought it back. Once the conversation moves past a failed turn, the failure shows as a small "Failed · reason" note in the history instead of a full banner with no way to act on it.

## 0.12.3

### Changed

- **Ultra is gone from the effort picker.** Checked against a real `muse serve` 1.3.0: picking Ultra sends `max` to the model, so it was Max under another name, and the Muse CLI no longer offers it either. Max is now the top of the scale. A thread or setting left on Ultra carries on as Max, and `/effort ultra` still works and means Max.

## 0.12.2

### Fixed

- **Links open in your browser.** Clicking a link in a reply, like a pull request Muse mentions, did nothing in the desktop app. Web and mail links now open in the default browser or mail app, and a link can no longer navigate the Helicon window away. File links still open in the file viewer.

## 0.12.1

### Fixed

- **macOS stops asking for folder access over and over.** The app bundle was not properly signed, so macOS could not remember an Allow and asked again for every project, once for each process Helicon runs. The whole app is now signed as one, so a protected location like Documents asks once. Builds are not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID, so expect one prompt per location again after each update.

### New

- **Close the plan, goal and background-task cards.** Each card above the composer has a close button. A closed card stays hidden in that thread; while one has something to show, a button in the thread's top bar brings it back.

## 0.12.0

### New

- **Muse for Windows, no WSL.** Muse Code now runs natively on Windows, and Helicon runs it that way. When Muse for Windows is installed (`irm https://dev.meta.ai/install.ps1 | iex` in PowerShell), Helicon runs it directly with your Windows paths, runs `!` commands in PowerShell, and never starts WSL. Muse inside WSL2 keeps working: Helicon uses it when native Muse is not installed, and `HELICON_MUSE_RUNTIME=wsl` (or `--runtime wsl` for the web server) keeps WSL when both are. Threads started in WSL live with WSL's Muse, so they stay there. Setup, the sidebar status and Settings show which one is in use.
- **A file viewer beside the thread.** The folder button in the thread's top bar, or Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E, opens the project's files on the right: a tree you can search by name, tabs, and a resizable panel.
  - Source files show with syntax highlighting and line numbers, and a link to a line range scrolls to and marks it.
  - Markdown opens as a rendered preview, with a toggle to its source, which you can edit and save (Cmd/Ctrl+S). If the file changed on disk since you opened it, Helicon asks before overwriting.
  - Images, video, audio and PDFs preview in place; anything else opens in its default app.
  - File paths Muse mentions in a reply, the files on read, edit and write tool rows, and the changed-file chips under a turn all open in the viewer. A file Muse edits reloads while it is open.
  - The viewer reads and writes only inside the project folder, and serves files so that a page in the project cannot run inside Helicon.

## 0.11.1

### Fixed

- **Dragging a project to reorder the sidebar works again.** The drop marker showed where a project would land, but letting go left the order unchanged, in the desktop app and in the browser alike. The drop handler was reading which project was being dragged from state captured before the drag began, when nothing was.

## 0.11.0

Built on the Muse Session Protocol methods that shipped with Muse Code 1.3.0, each checked against a real `muse serve` host.

### New

- **Plan usage.** The 5-hour window and the weekly cap, as Muse reports them with each model call, with when each resets. A small meter sits in the sidebar footer and a full card leads the usage page. This is your actual allowance, not the API-rate estimate the rest of the usage page shows. (`usage/read`, `usage/changed`)
- **Goal controls.** `/goal <objective>` now sets the goal through Muse's own goal command, which starts work on it straight away. `/goal pause`, `/goal resume` and `/goal clear` work from the composer, and the goal panel has Pause, Resume and Clear. Hosts without the goal commands keep the old behaviour. (`goal/set`, `edit`, `pause`, `resume`, `clear`)
- **Background tasks.** A running tool call can be sent to the background and keeps running while Muse moves on; one running there can be stopped, and a bar above the composer stops every background task in the thread at once. (`task/background`, `task/stop`, `task/stopAll`)
- **Workflow controls.** Cancel a running workflow, and skip or retry one of its agents from the workflow details sheet. (`workflow/cancel`, `workflow/childControl`)
- **Subagent controls.** Message a running subagent, give a finished one a follow-up task, stop, pause, resume, reopen or close it. These appear on subagents that carry a subagent id; Muse Code 1.3.0 does not report one yet (meta-models/muse-code-sdk#13), so they light up once it does. (`subagent/*`)
- **Full tool output.** Output Muse trimmed in the view gets a "Show full output" button that reads the stored log a page at a time. (`item/readOutput`)

### Fixed

- **Reasoning effort now takes effect.** Muse Code 1.3.0 accepts the effort sent with each turn and then drops it before the model call (meta-models/muse-code-sdk#6). Helicon now also sets it as the session's standing default, which Muse does apply, and the effort picker updates the open thread immediately.

### Changed

- **Skills come from the session.** With a thread open, the slash menu lists the skills Muse itself resolves for that session, and refreshes when Muse says they changed; the `muse skills list` CLI call remains for new threads and for reading a skill's instructions. Skills that declare an argument hint show it. (`skill/list`, `skill/changed`)
- **Renames reach Muse.** Renaming a thread renames the Muse session too, so the CLI and `/name` addressing see the same name, and a rename made in another Muse client shows up here. (`session/rename`, `session/nameChanged`)
